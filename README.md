#Toucan
Toucan is a .NET Core (DNX Core) library for ASP.NET 5 and MVC 6. Toucan was inspired by the Rails gems CanCan and Canard, and is intended to provide a resource authorization library for MVC applications that provides for declarative resource loading and authorization without requiring developers to load and authorize resources imperatively in controller actions. All resource permissions are defined in a single location and not duplicated across controllers, views, and database queries.

## Not stable
The branching strategy is in flux as this is a new project and development efforts are driving toward an initial releasable NuGet package for consumption against the RC1 DNX Core 50 runtimes. As work settles down the vison is that Master will be stable with the tagged milestone releases, while the Dev branch will be the unstable mainline for forward development.
